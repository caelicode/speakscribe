    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 28, 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>SpeakScribe is a Chrome extension that converts speech to text directly in your browser. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data the extension accesses, how it is used, and what is stored.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>SpeakScribe does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers. All speech processing happens locally in your browser.</p>
    <p>Specifically, SpeakScribe does not collect: your name, email address, browsing history, audio recordings, transcription content, IP address, or any other personally identifiable information.</p>

    <h2>Speech Processing</h2>
    <p>When using the Web Speech API engine, your browser sends audio to Google's speech recognition servers for processing. This is a built-in browser feature and is governed by Google's privacy policy, not by SpeakScribe. SpeakScribe does not have access to or control over this data transfer.</p>
    <p>When using the Whisper AI engine (Pro feature), all speech processing happens entirely on your device. No audio data leaves your computer.</p>

    <h2>Local Storage</h2>
    <p>SpeakScribe uses Chrome's local storage API to save your preferences (language selection, engine choice, theme settings) and license status. This data stays on your device and is never transmitted externally.</p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>The extension requests the following permissions, each used solely for the stated purpose:</p>
    <p><strong>activeTab:</strong> To inject the transcription widget and insert transcribed text into the active webpage.</p>
    <p><strong>storage:</strong> To save your preferences and license status locally across sessions.</p>
    <p><strong>downloads:</strong> To export your transcripts as files (TXT, SRT, Markdown, JSON) to your computer.</p>
    <p><strong>tabCapture:</strong> To capture tab audio for meeting transcription mode.</p>
    <p><strong>offscreen:</strong> To process audio for Whisper AI transcription in the background.</p>

    <h2>License Validation</h2>
    <p>If you purchase a Pro license, SpeakScribe communicates with LemonSqueezy's license API to validate your license key. The only data sent is your license key and a device instance identifier. No personal information, browsing data, or transcription content is included in these requests.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>SpeakScribe does not integrate with any analytics, advertising, or tracking services. The only external communication is license validation through LemonSqueezy (Pro users only) and the browser's built-in Web Speech API.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Since SpeakScribe does not collect data externally, there is nothing to retain or delete on our end. Your local preferences can be cleared by uninstalling the extension or clearing Chrome's extension storage.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>SpeakScribe does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years of age.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, contact us at <a href="mailto:bertrandmbanwi@gmail.com">bertrandmbanwi@gmail.com</a>.</p>
